I am a 47 year-old career changer. Pronouns she/her. Married, no children. Career changes are not new to me. You could almost call me a chronic career changer. I worked in social and non-profit work, then physical therapy, now looking to get into data science. I like dogs, plants and tacos. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
